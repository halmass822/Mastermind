# Mastermind

Creating the Mastermind board game in vanilla javascript! It's similar to wordle but with colors instead of letters

There is a combination of 4 colours you have to guess. Click the large boxes on the left and click submit to make a guess, and the results will be the boxes on the right. A white box means one of the colours (you won't know which one) has the correct position and the correct colour. A black box means it is the correct colour but wrong position.

Have fun!
